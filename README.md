# üß† Multimodal RAG Learning Assistant

A simple yet powerful learning assistant built with **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini**. Chat with your study materials‚Äîincluding PDFs with text, images, and even handwritten notes‚Äîand get clear, sourced answers.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multimodal Chat**: Interact with both PDF documents and images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).
* **Advanced OCR**: Gemini's powerful vision model extracts text from images, including diagrams and handwritten notes.
* **Sourced Answers**: Never lose track of where information comes from. Every answer is backed by the specific text snippets and images from your documents.
* **Vector-Powered Search**: Utilizes Google's embedding models and a FAISS vector store for fast and contextually relevant information retrieval.
* **Intuitive Interface**: A clean and easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to understand and answer questions about your documents.

1.  **üì§ Ingestion**: You upload your PDF files and images through the web interface.
2.  **üîç Extraction & OCR**: The app processes PDFs to extract both text and embedded images. For every image, Google Gemini performs OCR to transcribe any visible text.
3.  **üß† Vectorization**: All extracted text is chunked and converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) using Google's `text-embedding-004` model. These are stored in an efficient FAISS vector store.
4.  **üí¨ Generation**: When you ask a question, the app:
    * Searches the vector store for the most relevant text chunks.
    * Identifies relevant source images.
    * Passes this rich context (text + images) to the Gemini model to generate a comprehensive, context-aware answer.
